Part 1
======
[A] The total number of memory reads is: 1,024
    This is because there are 4 movq's per inner loop iteration
    The inner loop iterates 16 times
    The inner loop is run 16 times
    Thus, there are 4 * 16 * 16 = 1,024 memory reads

[B] Since our cache has 64 byte blocks, there will be a miss every 8 reads to the cache.
    This is because we read 8 bytes at a time (sizeof(long) == 8, and movq moves 8 bytes
    at a time). Thus when we attempt to read a 9th long, a miss will occur.
    Therefore, of the 1,024 reads to memory, 128 will miss the cache.

[C] Our miss rate is 1/8 (12.5 %).
