1. [25] Consider the following C code:

----------------------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>

void printBytes(unsigned char * start, int len) {
	for(int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
		printf(" %.2x", start[i]);
	}
	printf("\n");
}

void printInt(int x) {
	printBytes((unsigned char *) &x, sizeof(int));
}

void printFloat(float x) {
	printBytes((unsigned char *) &x, sizeof(float));
}
----------------------------------------------------

Copy and paste the above code into a file named 1-1. Ad the following functions
to the file, taking the indicated data yped as a parameter and calling
printBytes as appropriate: printShort, printLong, printDouble.

Also write a main() function to test each of the above functions (with the 
exception of printBytes, which you do not need to test directly) with
reasonable
