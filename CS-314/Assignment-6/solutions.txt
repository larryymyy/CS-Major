Part 2-b
========
sum += u[i] * v[i] cannot be pipelined because it depends on the results of u[i] * v[i].
It cannot start the addition of: sum + (u[i] * v[i]) until u[i] * v[i] has been calculated.

Similarly, i++ cannot be pipelined until sum += u[i] * v[i] has been calculated as it is an 
arithmetic operation. Thus, it must wait for the previous operation to finish since it will
be setting processor flags.
