4. [15] The balance factor of a node 'v' in a binary tree is defined to be the height
   of the left subtree of 'v' minus the height of the right subtree of 'v'. The height of
   a null node is defined to be -1. Suppose you are given a binary tree 'T' whose
   nodes have a balance factor field: v.balfac which has not yet been initialized.
   Write pseudo-code which will correctly assign values to the balance factor fields
   of all nodes of 'T'

   Your algorithm should run in linear time. In addition to v.balfac, you will be
   using the fields v.lchild, v.rchild, and T.root


setBalance(Node v):
	if(v == null):
		return
	setBalance(v.lchild)
	setBalance(v.rchild)
	v.balfac = getBalance(v.lchild) - (v.rchild)
	return

getBalance(Node v):
	if(v == null):
		return -1
	else:
		return v.balfac
